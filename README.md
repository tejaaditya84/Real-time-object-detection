Real-Time Object Detection System
üåü Project Overview
This project implements a real-time object detection system. It's designed to identify and locate various objects within a live video stream or from images, providing instant visual feedback on what it "sees." This system is useful for applications requiring immediate object recognition, such as surveillance, robotics, or interactive experiences.

‚ú® Features
Real-time Detection: Processes video frames or images as they come in, providing immediate object recognition.
Object Identification: Accurately identifies different categories of objects (e.g., people, cars, animals, etc.).
Bounding Box Visualization: Draws boxes around detected objects and labels them with their identified class and confidence score.
Lightweight Model: Utilizes a lightweight YOLOv8n model for efficient performance, making it suitable for various hardware configurations.
üöÄ How to Run the System
To get this object detection system up and running on your machine, follow these simple steps:

Prerequisites:

Make sure you have Python installed on your computer (Python 3.8+ is recommended).
You will also need pip (Python's package installer), which usually comes with Python.
Install Required Libraries:

Open your command prompt or terminal.
Navigate to your project directory (where your magic_detector.py and yolov8n.pt files are).
Install the necessary Python libraries by running:
pip install ultralytics opencv-python
(Note: ultralytics provides the YOLOv8 functionality, and opencv-python is for handling video and images.)
Run the Detector:

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the main detection script.

In your project directory, open your command prompt/terminal and execute:

python magic_detector.py
The system should then start, and if you have a webcam, it will likely try to use it for real-time detection.

(Optional: If you have a run_detector.bat file, you might just be able to double-click that, but running python magic_detector.py in the terminal is the most reliable way to start.)

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the system.
Ultralytics YOLOv8: The core deep learning model used for object detection (yolov8n.pt is the specific model weight).
OpenCV (opencv-python): Used for video stream processing, image manipulation, and displaying the detection results.
